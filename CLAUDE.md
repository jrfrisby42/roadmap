## What this project is

**Frazil Roadmap** is an internal, multi-tenant team roadmap / Gantt / Kanban / planning tool. It is live in production at `https://roadmap.frazil.app` (running on EC2). Current version is **3.1.0** (set in both `server.py` `APP_VERSION` and `roadmap.html` `const APP_VERSION`).

The whole app is **two files**:

- `server.py` — FastAPI + SQLite backend (~3,100 lines)
- `roadmap.html` — entire frontend: HTML, CSS, and JS in one file (~13,200 lines)

No build step. No bundler. No npm. The HTML file is served directly by FastAPI at `/`. This is intentional — it keeps deploy to a single `scp` of two files.

## How to run locally

```bash
python server.py
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Optional `.env` next to `server.py` (loaded on startup):

```
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://freezingpointllc.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=...
TOKEN_SECRET=<long random hex>     # signs auth tokens. If absent, a secret is persisted
                                   # to .token_secret next to server.py (shared across
                                   # workers, survives restart). Set explicitly in prod.
CORS_ORIGINS=https://roadmap.frazil.app
DEBUG_TRACEBACKS=0                 # 1/true to echo Python tracebacks in 500 responses
                                   # (default off — tracebacks are always logged server-side)

# Email (Amazon SES over SMTP) — powers self-service password reset + user invites.
# If unset, forgot-password silently no-ops and send-invite returns 503.
MAIL_FROM=notifications@frazil.app
SES_SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
SES_SMTP_PORT=587
SES_SMTP_USER=<SES SMTP username>  # SES console → SMTP settings (NOT your IAM keys)
SES_SMTP_PASS=<SES SMTP password>
APP_BASE_URL=https://roadmap.frazil.app   # base for emailed reset/invite links
```

Add a team: `python server.py --new-team acme` (prints an initial admin password and forces a change on first login).

---

## Testing

There is now a backend test suite under `tests/` (pytest + FastAPI `TestClient`). It is **not** shipped to production and has no bearing on the two-file deploy.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # pytest + httpx (one-time)
pytest                                 # runs tests/ (scoped via pytest.ini)
```

How isolation works (see `tests/conftest.py`):
- `server.py` reads `TENANTS_DIR` from the `FRAZIL_TENANTS_DIR` env var (default `/data/tenants`). The suite points it at a throwaway temp dir **before** importing `server`, because `boot()` runs at import time. Real tenant data is never touched.
- `TOKEN_SECRET` is pinned and Jira creds are blanked in `conftest.py` before import.
- Each test gets a fresh uniquely-named team. Role-gating/business-logic tests mint tokens directly via `server.create_token(...)` to skip the login rate limiter; the login flow itself is covered in `test_auth.py`.

Current coverage (`tests/`, ~49 tests): liveness; auth + role gating + login rate limit; the `testWeeks >= dueWeeks` 422; `parallelResources` rounding (create *and* update) + active-status lock; config `VALID_KEYS` allowlist + `/api/all` shape; capacity overrides (upsert/validation/ceiling/batch/delete/effective resolution); and planning sessions (lifecycle, payload validation, and atomic commit applying Review/Sprint/Release/deferral status changes through the config-driven status-flag maps). Extend it when you touch those areas. Run `pytest` before any deploy.

Not yet covered: Jira sync (would need HTTP mocking of `urllib`), recurrence spawning, and comments/activities. Good next targets.

---

## PWA (installable standalone app)

The app is an installable PWA. To preserve the two-file deploy, **all PWA assets are served as FastAPI routes** (no static files):

- `GET /manifest.webmanifest` — web app manifest (`_PWA_MANIFEST` dict in `server.py`)
- `GET /sw.js` — service worker (`_PWA_SW_TEMPLATE`; `__APP_VERSION__` is substituted at request time so the cache name tracks `APP_VERSION`)
- `GET /icon-192.png`, `/icon-512.png`, `/apple-touch-icon.png` — PNG bytes base64-embedded in the `_PWA_ICON_*_B64` constants

`roadmap.html` links the manifest + apple/theme-color meta tags in `<head>`, and registers `/sw.js` at the end of the single `<script>` block.

**Caching strategy (deliberate):** network-first for the app shell / navigations so a `roadmap.html` deploy goes live immediately (consistent with "HTML changes need no restart"); cache-first only for our own icons/manifest; **`/api/*` is network-only** — there is no offline data layer (it would conflict with the server-validated planning/snapshot conflict model). Don't make the service worker cache API responses without a deliberate redesign.

**Regenerating icons:** `python tools/gen_pwa_icons.py` (needs `pip install pillow` — Pillow is **dev-only**, NOT a runtime dependency). It redraws the brand map-pin and rewrites the three `_PWA_ICON_*_B64` constants in `server.py` in place. Run the JS/Python syntax checks after. Deploy is still just `scp server.py roadmap.html`.

---

## Auth emails: password reset & user invites (Amazon SES via SMTP)

Self-service password management, sent through SES over **SMTP** (stdlib `smtplib` — no boto3, no new runtime dep). Config via the `MAIL_FROM` / `SES_SMTP_*` / `APP_BASE_URL` env vars above; **degrades gracefully when unset** (forgot-password no-ops, `send-invite` → 503).

- **Users have an `email` field** (admins populate it). Emails are validated + **unique per team**, because **login accepts username *or* email**.
- **Reset/invite tokens** reuse the HMAC signing infra (`make_password_token` / `decode_password_token`) and are **bound to the user's current password hash** → single-use (a link dies once the password is set/changed). No DB table.
- Endpoints: `POST /api/forgot-password` (public, rate-limited, **uniform response** — no email enumeration), `POST /api/reset-password` (sets pw via token), `POST /api/users/{username}/send-invite` (admin → emails a 7-day setup link; reset links are 1 hour).
- Frontend: "Forgot password?" on the login wall; a `?pwtoken=…` set-password screen (handled first thing in `boot()` via `checkPasswordTokenParam()`); Add-User offers **"Set password now" vs "Email a setup link"**; per-user mail button re-sends a link; a **pending** badge marks users with no password yet.
- New-user "send link" path creates the user with **no password** (a pending account that can't log in until the link is used), then calls `send-invite`.

---

## Tech stack & dependencies

- **Backend:** FastAPI, uvicorn, gunicorn, sqlite3 (stdlib), `urllib.request` for Jira HTTP calls. No `requests`, no SQLAlchemy, no ORM — keep it that way unless we have a real reason to change.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + CSS in one HTML file. No frameworks, no React, no build step. SVG icons inline.
- **DB:** SQLite, one file per team at `/data/tenants/{team}/roadmap.db`. WAL mode.
- **Auth:** Custom HMAC-signed tokens (not JWT). See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Jira:** Atlassian Cloud REST API v3, hand-rolled HTTP via `urllib`.

## Working conventions (READ THIS BEFORE EDITING)

These have been hard-won across many sessions. Following them saves churn.

### 1. The HTML file is monolithic — accept it, don't fight it

`roadmap.html` is one ~13k-line file with `<style>`, then HTML body, then a single `<script>` block. We've discussed splitting it; the consensus is **don't** unless we're doing a full SPA rewrite. Splitting buys ergonomics only, costs the deploy simplicity, and risks breaking working code with no test suite.

When editing, navigate by searching for function names (`function renderKanban`) or DOM ids (`id="capCalModalBg"`).

### 2. Edit with `str_replace`, not by rewriting the whole file

Both files are large. Use `str_replace` with enough surrounding context to make the match unique. Never overwrite the whole file unless you really need to (e.g., a major refactor).

When patching the frontend programmatically (e.g. a Python `str_replace` script inside `bash_tool`), always run a syntax check after:

```bash
# Python
python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('server.py').read()); print('server.py OK')"

# JS inside the HTML
python3 -c "
import re
c = open('roadmap.html').read()
s = re.findall(r'<script>(.*?)</script>', c, re.DOTALL)[0]
open('/tmp/chk.js','w').write(s)
" && node --check /tmp/chk.js && echo 'JS OK'
```

The HTML has exactly one `<script>` block (no `src=`); the regex above grabs it. If a future change adds more script tags, adapt accordingly.

### 3. Status semantics are config-driven — never hardcode status names

Status names are per-team configurable. Behavior is driven by boolean flag maps stored in the `config` table:

- `statusIsActive` — counts toward capacity, locks parallelResources edits
- `statusIsTerminal` — completed; excludes from active counts
- `statusIsDefault` — exactly one true; default for new items
- `statusIsDeferred` — exactly one true; assigned when an item is deferred in a planning session
- `statusIsReleased` — exactly one true; triggers FF pull from Jira hierarchy
- `statusIsApproved` — exactly one true; set by Review planning sessions
- `statusIsTesting` — exactly one true; the "in testing" phase

Never write `if status == "In Progress"`. Always resolve through the flag maps. Helpers exist on both server (inside `commit_planning_session`) and client (`getDefaultStatus()`, `getDeferredStatus()`, `isActiveStatus()`, etc.).

### 4. Items (`projects` table) are JSON blobs

The `projects` table is literally `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT`. The full item is JSON-serialized into `data`. This means:

- You cannot SQL-index individual fields.
- `get_all` (`GET /api/all`) returns everything for the team in one shot; the frontend keeps it in memory in `projects[]`.
- "Items" and "projects" are the same thing in this codebase — historical naming. The actual project/product (Fraznet, HubSpot, etc.) is a separate config key called `products`.

### 5. The Jira sync is forward-only and change-gated

Jira → roadmap status sync **never regresses status**. It only advances. It tracks two per-item dicts to avoid re-processing:

- `jiraLastKnownStatus[ticket]` — the last Jira status we successfully consumed
- `jiraSyncSkipped[ticket]` — a Jira status we declined (because it would regress); we won't reprocess that same status again

If a Jira sync seems to not be picking up a change, those two dicts are the place to look.

Feature flags (`customfield_10064` in Jira, a label-type field) are walked across the full ticket hierarchy: ticket → epic → stories → subtasks. Result is deduped into `jiraFeatureFlags`. Manual flags live in `featureFlags`. The union is what gets shown.

### 6. Planning sessions are atomic, server-validated, server-applied

A planning session goes draft → committed (or discarded). Three types: **Review**, **Sprint**, **Release**. The frontend builds a `payload`; the server validates and applies all changes in a single DB transaction via `POST /api/planning-sessions/{id}/commit`. Validation rules live in `_validate_session_payload()`. Don't write per-item PUT loops for things a session covers — use the commit endpoint.

### 7. Capacity model

- `parallelResources` (per item) — how many resource units the item consumes during dev work.
- Phases: **Dev work** (`dueWeeks − testWeeks`) consumes `parallelResources`. **Testing** (`testWeeks`) consumes `1`. **Delay** (`revised − due`) consumes `1`.
- `parallelResources` is always rounded **up** to the nearest 0.25 (min 1.0). Done on the server in `round_up_to_quarter()` in `create_project` and `update_project`.
- `parallelResources` cannot be changed while the item is in an active status — server returns 422.
- Per-owner per-day overrides live in the `capacity_overrides` table. Defaults come from the `ownerCapacity` config key.

### 8. Test period cannot equal or exceed time estimate

`testWeeks >= dueWeeks` returns HTTP 422 on PUT. Enforce on the client too; don't bypass on the server.

### 9. Parent/child vs requires/dependent are different things

- **Parent / child** = organizational containment (an epic and its work items). No date relationship. A parent is a label, not a scheduling constraint.
- **Requires / dependent** = scheduling. Item B requires item A — A must happen before B (or alongside, if `parallel` is set on the requirement).

An item can only have one of these two relationships — enforced in the UI via mutual exclusion when picking "Parent Item" or "Depends On" in the item modal.

### 10. Roles

- `viewer` — read-only. Cannot see Planning view. Kanban hidden from this role. Clicking a Gantt bar opens the read-only Item Page instead of the edit modal.
- `editor` — can create/update projects, capacity overrides, planning sessions. Time/date fields are read-only for editors when the item is in an active status. Editors can be **owner-scoped** via the per-user `ownerFilter` field (see below).
- `admin` — everything, plus config edits, user management, deletes.

Routes are gated with `Depends(require_role("admin", "editor"))` or similar. Never rely on the frontend to enforce a role — every state-changing endpoint must have a server-side `require_role`.

**Owner-scoped editors:** a user record can carry `ownerFilter: "<owner name>"`. When set on an editor, the UI scopes their view to items they own, locks the owner field in the edit modal, and shows a 📌 badge. This is UI-only scoping — server enforcement is by role, not by ownerFilter.

**The "primary admin" rule:** only the builtin admin user (the one created at team init) can change other admin users' passwords via `POST /api/users/{username}/password`. This is checked inside the endpoint, not in `require_role`.

### 11. XSS — always escape user content

The server-rendered audit log at `/audit` uses `html.escape()` on every dynamic value. Past XSS issues lived there. In the frontend, use the `esc()` helper before injecting into `innerHTML`.

### 12. Don't break the API surface

The frontend assumes:
- `GET /api/all` returns `{projects, config, activities, ...}` in one call
- `PUT /api/config/{key}` for any of the keys in `VALID_KEYS` (server.py line ~986)
- Token comes back from `POST /api/login`; client stores it as `frazil_token` in `localStorage` and sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `X-Team: <team>` on every request

If you're tempted to "improve" the API shape, check the frontend first — a lot depends on these contracts.

### 13. The Item Page is a separate UX surface from the modal

There are two ways to view an item:

- **Edit Modal** — opened by clicking a Gantt bar / Kanban card as admin or editor. Lightweight, focused on edits. JIRA quick-add and a compact notes field are here.
- **Item Page** — opened as `/?item={id}` (bookmarkable, shareable) or by clicking from a viewer's session. Full-screen overlay with Schedule card, JIRA tickets with live status, Dependencies, Activity history, Comments thread, Admin Controls. Pushes into `history.pushState`, restores on back button via a `popstate` handler.

Same data, same permission rules. If a field is read-only in the modal for a given role, it must be read-only on the Item Page too. Comments live on the Item Page only — not the modal. The "external link" icon next to the item name in the modal opens the Item Page in a new tab.

`checkItemPageParam()` runs on boot to handle deep links.

### 14. Recurrence is a single string field, not multiple flags

Item field `recurrence` is a string: `"none"` | `"weekly"` | `"biweekly"` | `"monthly"`. There is no separate `recurring` boolean. `recurrence === "none"` means non-recurring; anything else means recurring with that cadence.

Related fields:
- `syncChildren: bool` — for recurring items with a linked Jira ticket, pull Jira sub-issues into hidden roadmap children.
- `recurrence_parent: <pid>` — back-reference on a spawned occurrence to its predecessor in the chain.

When a recurring item becomes terminal, `POST /api/projects/{pid}/recur` spawns the next occurrence. New start = previous start + period (NOT today). The new item gets the team's `statusIsDefault` status, NOT a hardcoded "Planned". Children are NOT carried forward — they're pulled fresh from Jira after a new ticket is linked.

### 15. CSV import (HubSpot) lives in Admin → Data

The Admin Panel has a **Data** tab. It contains JSON export, JSON import, and CSV import (HubSpot Projects format). The CSV importer maps HubSpot fields to roadmap fields:

| HubSpot field | Roadmap field |
|---|---|
| `Name` | name |
| `Record ID` | `hubspotId` (used for duplicate detection) |
| `Pipeline Stage` | status (mapped through a status table) |
| `Owner` | owner (matched to existing developers; falls back to default) |
| `Start date` | start |
| `Target due date` | due (also computes dueWeeks) |
| `Close date` | releaseDate (if completed) |

The importer is a 3-step modal: Upload → Preview (shows new vs duplicate in green/amber) → Result. Duplicates are detected by name (case-insensitive) AND `hubspotId`; matches are skipped. The pipeline-stage mapping is hardcoded in the frontend — extend it there to support other CSV sources.

### 16. Saved Views, dark mode, and view persistence

**Saved Views** — accessible from the hamburger menu. Two system views (`My Work`, `At Risk`) plus user-created custom views. Stored in `localStorage` under key `frazil_saved_views_<username>` (per-user, not server-side). A view captures all dropdown filters, date range, view mode, group-by, and search term. Default view applies automatically on login.

**Dark mode** — toggle in the hamburger menu. Stored in `localStorage.frazil_dark_mode` (`'1'` or `'0'`). Default is light; falls back to OS `prefers-color-scheme` if unset. Implemented as `body.dark-mode` class with CSS variable overrides — `--bg`, `--surface`, `--surface2`, `--border`, `--row-sep`, `--text`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--accent2`, `--today-line`. All custom components must reference the variables, not hard-code colors, or they'll break in dark mode.

**View mode** (Gantt / Kanban / Planning / Dashboard) is in `sessionStorage.frazil_view`. The select order in the UI is fixed: Gantt → Kanban → Planning → Dashboard.

### 17. Frontend storage keys — full inventory

`localStorage` (persistent):
- `frazil_token` — bearer token
- `frazil_rm_session` — `'1'` if logged in
- `frazil_rm_user` — username
- `frazil_rm_role` — `'viewer'`/`'editor'`/`'admin'`
- `frazil_rm_team` — current team slug
- `frazil_rm_login_ts` — login timestamp (ms)
- `frazil_dark_mode` — `'1'`/`'0'`
- `frazil_saved_views_<username>` — JSON array of saved views
- `frazil_default_view_<username>` — id of the default view

`sessionStorage` (per-tab):
- `frazil_view` — current view mode

The `SK` constant at the top of the script enumerates the older session keys: `const SK = { session:'frazil_rm_session', team:'frazil_rm_team' };`. New code should follow the `frazil_*` naming convention.

### 18. Jira description sync uses ADF

Jira REST API v3 requires Atlassian Document Format (ADF — a JSON node tree) for description updates, not plain text or HTML. The frontend `notesToADF(html)` helper converts the rich-text notes (HTML) to ADF: strip tags, decode entities, convert `<br>`, `<p>`, `<li>` to newlines/bullets, wrap each paragraph in an ADF paragraph node.

Pushing notes to Jira goes through `PUT /api/jira/issue/{key}` with `{ fields: { description: <ADF> } }`. The server passes this through to Jira's PUT endpoint. ADF parsing (Jira → roadmap, for display) is in `adf_to_text()` in `get_jira_issue`.

---

## Common tasks

### Add a new endpoint

1. Decide the role gate (`admin` only? `admin` + `editor`?).
2. Add the route in `server.py` near related routes (Jira routes are clustered, planning routes are clustered, etc.).
3. Use `auth: dict = Depends(require_role(...))` and read `auth["team"]`, `auth["username"]`.
4. Wrap DB access in `with db(team) as c:` — the helper handles commit/rollback.
5. Call `write_audit(team, "action", username, pid, name, changes=...)` for any mutation worth tracking.
6. Frontend: add a method to the `API` object near `const API = {` (~line 1990 in roadmap.html) — it handles the auth header and X-Team automatically.

### Add a new config key

1. Add the key name to `VALID_KEYS` in `server.py` (the `PUT /api/config/{key}` allowlist).
2. Add the default in the `defaults` dict inside `init_team_db()`.
3. Also add the key in `_migrate_config_keys()` so existing team DBs get backfilled on next boot.
4. Frontend: declare the variable at module top (near `let ownerCapacity = {}`), load it in `boot()` from `data.config`, and persist with `API.putConfig(key, value)`.

### Add a new status flag (e.g. `statusIsX`)

1. Add to `VALID_KEYS` and `init_team_db` defaults `{}` and `_migrate_config_keys`.
2. Add a `let statusIsX = {}` at the top of the script in `roadmap.html`.
3. Load it from config in `boot()`.
4. If the rule is "exactly one true" (like Default/Deferred/Released), enforce it in the admin status editor and on save.
5. Use the flag map everywhere, never the literal status name.

### Modify items (server-side)

Items are JSON blobs in `projects.data`. The pattern is always:

```python
with db(team) as c:
    row = c.execute("SELECT data FROM projects WHERE id=?", (pid,)).fetchone()
    if not row: raise HTTPException(404, "Item not found")
    p = json.loads(row["data"])
    # ... modify p ...
    c.execute("UPDATE projects SET data=? WHERE id=?", (json.dumps(p), pid))
```

### Run a Jira sync

- Per-item pull: `POST /api/jira/pull/{pid}`
- Per-item push status: `POST /api/jira/sync-status/{pid}`
- Bulk pull all: `POST /api/jira/pull-all` (called from the "Sync Jira" button)
- Child sync for recurring items: `POST /api/projects/{pid}/sync-children` (driven by `syncChildren: true` on the item)

---

## What I should NOT do unprompted

- Don't migrate to PostgreSQL.
- Don't split the HTML file into separate JS modules.
- Don't add a build step (no Vite, no esbuild, no webpack).
- Don't introduce a frontend framework (no React, Vue, Svelte, HTMX).
- Don't add an ORM (no SQLAlchemy, no SQLModel).
- Don't change the `X-Team` header convention.
- Don't change the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` shape.
- A backend pytest suite now exists under `tests/` (see the **Testing** section). Don't add a *new* test framework (e.g. playwright/frontend e2e) unprompted — extend the existing pytest suite instead.

These are real choices we've made, not oversights. If something looks like it would benefit from one of these, flag it and ask first.

---

## Style notes

- Comments use `# ── Heading ─────...` boxes for major sections in `server.py`. Match the style for new sections.
- Server code is generally 4-space indent, type hints where convenient but not exhaustive.
- Frontend uses 2-space indent. Function names are camelCase.
- Error messages should be specific: `"Test period (3w) cannot equal or exceed the time estimate (3w)"` not `"Invalid"`.

## Deployment cheat sheet

Full details in `DEPLOYMENT.md`. The fast version:

- Production host: `ubuntu@52.35.224.183` (Elastic IP), EC2 `t4g.small`, Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64
- App path: `/opt/roadmap/`
- DB path: `/data/tenants/{team}/roadmap.db` (separate EBS volume at `/data`)
- Reverse proxy: Caddy at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, auto-SSL via Let's Encrypt
- Service: systemd unit `roadmap.service` running `gunicorn server:app -w 2 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 127.0.0.1:8000`
- Deploy: `scp server.py roadmap.html ubuntu@52.35.224.183:/opt/roadmap/`
- HTML changes need NO restart (Caddy reads it fresh). `server.py` changes need `sudo systemctl restart roadmap`.
- Logs: `/var/log/roadmap-access.log`, `/var/log/roadmap-error.log`, plus `journalctl -u roadmap`
